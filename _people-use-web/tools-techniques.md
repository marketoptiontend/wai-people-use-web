- **Easy-to-read text**{:#etr} – simplified summaries for passages of text to help make it easier to understand.
- **Progressive disclosure**{:#progressive} – design technique that involves showing only the least amount of information or functions necessary for a given task or purpose, to avoid overloading the user with information.
- **Reduced interface**{:#reduced} – representation of the content that only shows most relevant information or more frequently used functions; for example, by hiding other parts of the content that can distract users.
- **Screen magnification**{:#display} – changing the settings of the web browser, operating system, or screen to enlarge or reduce text size and images. Some people use magnification lenses, binoculars, or other visual aids, and software such as [screen magnifiers](#magnifiers){:.termref} to better see the content.
- **Sign language**{:#sign} – a visual form of communication that is primarily used by people who are deaf. It involves hand, body, and facial expressions to transmit words, phrase, and tone. For instance, the intensity of a gesture could indicate the mood or emphasis of particular information. As in written languages, there are many sign languages and dialects, some of which are recognized as official languages in some countries. Not all people who have auditory disabilities or who are deaf know sign language.
- **Symbols**{:#symbols} – icons that represent words or concepts used instead of text by some people with impaired communication, including people with difficulties to read or write.

## Input  typing, writing, and clicking {#input}

People use different approaches to enter text and activate commands. For instance, some people do not use a mouse, keyboard, or both, while others use specific configurations for keyboard and mouse, or use alternative hardware and software altogether. Examples of input include using:

- Keyboard only by people with cognitive, physical, and visual disabilities;
- Touch screen only by people with cognitive and physical disabilities;
- Mouse and keyboard with software that compensates for hand tremor;
- Voice recognition (speech input) and other hands-free interaction.

{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}

### More about input {#more-about-input}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Some people use software and customized settings to enhance the efficiency of typing, writing, and clicking. For example, some people assign personalized shortcut keys to functions they frequently use. Some people use word prediction software to help complete words and sentences with minimal typing, grammar and spelling tools to help correct text, and tools to help click, select text, and scroll with minimal movement.

Web content needs to be designed to support these different types of approaches. For example, forms, links, and other functionality need to be usable by keyboard. In particular, web applications ("client-side scripting"), embedded media players, and other programmatic objects need to provide full keyboard support that does not trap the keyboard focus within the program and larger clickable areas for buttons and links.

Accessible web content supports people who need more time typing, writing, and clicking, or are more likely to make mistakes. For instance, some people forget to select options and fill out form entries, misspell words and mistype data (such as dates), or unintentionally activate buttons and links. Accessible web content also provides enough time to complete tasks, clear and helpful error messages and options for correcting input.

### Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies {#examples-of-assistive-technologies-and-adaptive-strategies-2}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

- **Accelerators**{:#accelerators} – software and functionality that help reduce the effort needed to type or click. For example, by providing options to create shortcuts for commands or sequences of commands, by highlighting selection choices such as menu items, links, or options, and by helping to steer the mouse.
- **Alternative keyboard and mouse**{:#input} – hardware and software primarily used by people with cognitive and physical disabilities to help interact with the computer. Examples include:
  - Keyboards with larger keys, key labels, key spacing, illuminated keys, or custom layouts;
  - On-screen keyboards, touch-screens, sip-and-puff switches, and single-key switches;
  - Trackballs, joysticks, touchpads, specially designed mice, and other pointing devices;
  - [Voice recognition](#voice){:.termref}, [eye tracking](#gaze){:.termref}, and other approaches for hands-free interaction.
- **Eye tracking**{:#gaze} (sometimes called "eye-gaze") - a system that monitors eye movement to control the mouse pointer and detects blinking to initiate mouse clicks.
- **Keyboard customization**{:#kbd} – includes changing the mapping of keys, assigning shortcut keys to functions, setting [filters](#filters){:.termref}, and setting "sticky keys" to support single-handed typing.
- **Keyboard and mouse filters**{:#filters} – functions of the operating system or software tools that recognize and compensate for involuntary movements such as tremor and spasms.
- **Mouse customization**{:#mouse} – includes changing the mapping of buttons, changing the sensitivity of the mouse towards movement, setting [filters](#filters){:.termref}, and changing the size and appearance of the mouse pointer.
- **On-screen keyboard**{:#screenkbd} – virtual keyboard displayed on a screen so that it can be used with a touchscreen, mouse, trackball, joystick, or other pointing devices.
- **Spelling and grammar tools**{:#lexical} – web browser functions, plug-ins, or other software tools to help users write.
- **Voice recognition**{:#voice} (sometimes called "speech input" or "voice command") - software that recognizes the human voice and can be used to dictate text or to issue commands to operate the computer.
- **Word prediction**{:#prediction} – software that presents selections of matching words, phrases, or sentences based on the current input (and sometimes context) to save typing.

## Interaction  navigating and finding {#interaction}

People navigate and find content using different strategies and approaches depending on their preferences, skills, and abilities. For instance, someone using a website for the first time may need clearer guidance than someone who has more experience with the particular site, and someone using the Web on a mobile device with a small screen may require more orientational cues than someone using a desktop computer. While these are typically usability aspects that affect people with and without disabilities, some situations affect people with disabilities to a greater extent.

{% include excol.html type="start" id="" %}

### More about interaction {#more-about-interaction}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Examples of such situations include:

- A person is not seeing the screen and needing to get an overview and orient themselves by scanning the headings on a web page; the headings need to be also designed to support such purposes.
- A person who is only seeing small portions of the screen at a time due to screen magnification, and need to orient themselves using visual cues; the visual design needs to also support such purposes.
- A person using only the keyboard (or keyboard alternatives) to navigate through the web content; the structure of web pages need to be designed to also support and efficient use of the keyboard.
- A person who has difficulty remembering the addresses, names, or particular functionality of websites; web browsers need to provide supporting functionality that is easy to use and remember.
- A person who may have difficulty with hierarchical menu navigation, as how most navigation menus are designed to be; websites need to provide alternative mechanisms for navigation.

Many functions to support different styles of navigation are built directly into web browsers and assistive technologies. For example, most commonly available browsers provide bookmark functionality, and screen readers provide functions to list headings, links, and other structures on a web page. However, the design of the content is also an essential factor to support different styles of navigation.

### Examples of accessibility features {#examples-of-accessibility-features-2}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

- **Consistency and predictability**{:#consistency} – labeling of functions such as links, buttons, and controls should be consistent, and the expected function should be predictable from the label.
- **Descriptive titles, headings, and labels**{:#labels} – page titles, section headings, and labels for forms, links, and controls are sometimes read on their own or out of context and need to be descriptive.
- **Helpful error and success messages**{:#messages} – dialogs and other messages, such as after submitting forms, need to help users complete their tasks and avoid disorientation, distraction, confusion, or discomfort.
- **Multiple navigation mechanisms**{:#navigating} – websites need to provide multiple ways to locate web pages, for example by providing sitemaps and search functionality in addition to hierarchical navigation menus.
- **Skip links**{:#skip} – mechanisms to allow keyboard users to skip over repetitive blocks of content such as page headings, navigation bars, or menus. Note: too many skip links are counterproductive to this purpose.
- **Visual orientation cues**{:#cues} – examples include using background colors to indicate different parts of the content, using unique headings, and placing relevant information in prominent areas of a web page.

### Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies {#examples-of-assistive-technologies-and-adaptive-strategies-3}

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

- **Bookmarks and history**{:#bookmarks} – using web browser functions to help remember pages, find previously visited pages, or quickly go to pages without needing to type a web address.
- **Keyword search**{:#search} – using web browser functions to find text within a web page, and website functionality to search for web pages by keyword. Search engines that are maintained and optimized for a particular website can provide more precise search results.
- **Keyboard navigation**{:#keyboard} – moving through the content using the keyboard, typically by using the tab key to jump from one structural item such as link, header, or list item, to the next. Keyboard navigation largely depends on web browser support but also on website design features such as [skip links](#skip){:.termref}.
- **Page maps**{:#maps} – displaying a small image of the entire web page with an indicator highlighting the portion within the web page that is being currently viewed.
- **Pictorial links**{:#pictorial} – some web browsers, plug-ins, and websites show small images of the link targets (sometimes called "screen shots") rather than the addresses or names; for example in combination with [bookmarks and history](#bookmarks){:.termref} listings, back and forward buttons in web browsers, or links on web pages.
